- Test software with devices from other manufacturers.

- The software contains a support for a major subset of STAPL commands
  defined in the JEDEC standard. Try to broaden the parser to become
  fully compliant with the JEDEC standard some day.

  To accomplish this task, the original yacc/bison source would be
  more than desirable. We may try to ask Altera to release it, since
  the parser development is cumbersome without .y file.

- Make a support for 64-bit system. Program runs on 32-bit system
  only. The original code presumed that both long and pointer size are
  32 bits. Therefore, longs and unsigned longs were changed to int32_t
  and uint32_t, respectively. To make the software run on 64-bit
  architecture, int32_t must be set back to longs and fixed code
  blocks with explicit (long) and (long*) casting. The suspicious
  castings are on several places in jamarray.c, jamexec.c, and
  jamheap.c. However, the correction is not trivial task.

  Also there may be issues on big-endian architectures.

- Kill off local heap management and replace with malloc()/free()

- The code supposes that BOOL type is 4 bytes long instead of 1 byte as
  in case of "bool". So, typedef int BOOL is valid for now.
